I first made a copy and loaded it to VS Code. Then went through what code was given to me so I could get an understanding of what I was dealing with before doing anything meaningful, I tested if the backend server was even working and I could see the data on my browser, so I ran it on my PC using the .\start.bat command. Then in my browser I typed http://localhost:8000/medicines. This let me confirm that the backend was actually running and returning the JSON data properly. Once I saw the medicines showing up in the browser, I knew the backend environment was set up correctly and I could actually start looking into the rest of the challenge.
After that, I went through the backend code to understand it then getting all medicines, getting a single one, adding, updating, deleting, and even the average price function i made sure were working. I tested each endpoint in the browser, like the GET for all medicines and the average price one, and all of them worked fine. When I added something, it also saved into the data.json updating and deleting also worked fine. Backend-wise, everything was already there and working.
Next, I looked at the frontend. I opened it using Live Server and straight away the medicines showed up, which told me the frontend was talking to the backend correctly. It also handled missing values, like when a name is empty or when the price is null. It didn’t break. Then I tested the add medicine form. I tried adding a few things and it worked smoothly — it updated on the screen immediately and stayed there after refreshing, so that it was definitely saving it to the backend.
 
After making sure everything worked, I focused on improving the UI.. The first thing I added was a search bar so you can filter medicines by typing. Then i gave the website a new layout trying to make it very appealing and easy to understand what is going on.
Then I made some visual improvements. I updated the button colours to match NHS blue, and on hover I changed it to a lighter NHS-looking blue to make it look more professional. 
Later on, I decided to add update and delete features even though they weren’t required I added these buttons in the frontend, but instead of showing them all the time, I made it to only show when you click a specific medicine. That way the UI doesn’t look messy with buttons everywhere. Both of these refreshes the list automatically, so you always see the updated data.
By the end, the project has everything worked: backend features, frontend features, search, update, delete, average price, better UI, and proper error handling.

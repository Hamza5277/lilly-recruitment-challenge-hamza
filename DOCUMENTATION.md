I first made a copy and loaded it to VS Code. Then went through what code was given to me so I could get an understanding of what I was dealing with before doing anything meaningful. I tested if the backend server was even working and I could see the data on my browser, so I ran it on my PC using the .\start.bat command. Then in my browser I typed http://localhost:8000/medicines. This let me confirm that the backend was actually running and returning the JSON data properly. Once I saw the medicines showing up in the browser, I knew the backend environment was set up correctly and I could actually start looking into the rest of the challenge. I then read through all the code that was given so I could get a better grasp of what I was working with.
One of the goals was to fetch data from the backend and display it in a user-friendly way. My JavaScript handles this by making a GET request, storing all the medicines, and displaying them neatly inside styled cards. The layout makes everything easy to read, and each medicine has consistent formatting, so users instantly understand what they are looking at.
There was also the part about handling bad or missing data from the backend. Since the challenge mentioned that the database had gaps, I made sure the frontend wouldn’t break if something was missing. In my display function, if a medicine has no name, it shows “Unknown Medicine”, and if the price is null, it shows “Price not available”. This makes the site stable even if the backend returns imperfect data. Users can still see everything without errors or broken UI elements.
Another objective was making the app user-friendly when sending new data to the backend. Instead of expecting people to use API tools manually, I built a clean form on the frontend for adding medicines. When a user types in a name and price, the frontend validates the inputs and then sends them through a POST request to the backend. After adding, the list updates automatically so you instantly see the new medicine. This makes the whole process feel smooth and simple.
The challenge also mentioned improving the UI, so I designed the entire look of the site. I gave it a fresh layout, organised the content into cards, added better spacing, and used colours that make the app look more modern and readable. I styled the buttons using NHS-inspired blue shades and added hover animations. Everything is laid out clearly so new users immediately understand how the app works.
Then I added a search bar so you can filter medicines as you type. This makes the list much easier to navigate, especially once it gets long. After that, I added update and delete options to give the user full control over the medicines. To avoid cluttering the page with too many buttons, I made it, so the update/delete buttons only appear when you click a medicine. Both features connect directly to the backend and refresh the list straight after.
Finally, for the optional task of calculating the average price, I wrote a backend function that safely loops through all the medicines, ignores invalid prices, and returns a clean average. On the frontend, I added a button that calls this route and displays the result clearly inside a styled card. This means users can get an instant overview of pricing trends, which fits the idea of a quarterly report.
By the end, every part of the challenge was handled: fetching backend data in a clean way, handling missing database values safely, giving users an easy way to submit data, designing a much better UI, adding searching, updating and deleting, and calculating the average price.
